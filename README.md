## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
- Data source and separator
- Selected sensors for PCA
- Number of PCA components
- Health index threshold
- Units to plot
- Output settings

## Methods

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Reduces dimensionality of sensor data
- Captures most variance with fewer components
- Identifies dominant patterns

### Mahalanobis Distance
- Measures distance from normal operating state
- Accounts for correlation between features
- Higher distance indicates degradation

## Caveats

- Requires CMAPSS dataset or similar format.
- Threshold selection is critical for early warning.
- PCA assumes linear relationships; nonlinear methods may be needed for complex systems.
